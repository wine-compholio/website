	<div class="entry">

	<p>Wine Staging is an open source project licensed under the LGPL2 license (with some exceptions, see <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/blob/master/LICENSE.md">here</a>).</p>

	<h3 class="title">Source</h2>

	<p>The source code is currently hosted on <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Don't be surprised, this repository really contains mostly patches. In order to build Wine Staging you'll additionally need upstream Wine. The repository also contains a couple of helper scripts to simplify the steps of applying all or a subset of the patches. Detailed instructions how to build Wine Staging are available in our <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/wiki/Packaging">packaging instructions</a>.

	<h3 class="title">Contributing</h2>

	<p>We are also happy about contributions. If you for example spend a lot of time figuring out how to solve a specific issue, but have trouble with your patch getting accepted upstream, then we can also take a look at it and will add it if it passes our review. We will not accept hacks for single applications and all patches must at least have a minimum standard quality. If your patch does not fulfill these quality requirements, we will tell you about the remaining problems, and give you a chance to correct them. We are open for all other kind of patches and in contrast to upstream Wine, we also accept bigger work-in-progress patchsets. You can find more about this in our <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/wiki/Development">wiki</a>.</p>
