Today we released Wine Staging 1.7.44 with several bug fixes and switched to our new build system for our prebuilt packages. Currently most of our effort goes into fixing bugs instead of adding new features, so we also changed the format of the release notes a bit. Before we tell you more about the build system changes, here is a list of all fixed bugs / added features in this release (without any particular order).

As usual you can find all the changes (including removed/upstream accepted patches) in our <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/blob/v1.7.44/debian/changelog">changelog</a>.

<p>
There are also various changes regarding our build servers. We provide packages for a lot of distributions and some of them (Debian Jessie or newer, Arch Linux, Mageia) are directly built by our own servers. In the past we used LXC containers to optimize the performance, but this solution was too fragile. Many distributions do not work out of the box in LXC containers and might break on any update. Starting with this release we switched to our new KVM based build system which provides many advantages over our last approach. As part of this step we added <b>Debian Stretch</b> and <b>Mageia 5</b> as build target and removed AVLinux 6. AVLinux is moving away from Debian Squeeze to Jessie and does no longer provide updates, so we didn't move it to our new build server. We still provide Wine Staging 1.7.42 for download though.
</p>

<p>
We also added a test VM which is used for daily test runs of the Wine tests. This should help us to detect new regressions in Wine staging. We already used the wine tests manually when adding a new patch, but the executed tests were often limited to the changed component (because running all tests takes a lot of time) and were run in a non-clean environment. There are still some small tasks left to ensure that the pre-requirements for all tests are met, but after fixing those, the test results will be uploaded to our website and updated daily.
