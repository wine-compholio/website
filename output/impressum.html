	<p>Our website may be used without entering personal information. Different rules may apply to certain services on our site, however, and are explained separately below. We collect personal information from you (e.g. name, email address etc.) in accordance with the provisions of German data protection statutes. Information is considered personal if it can be associated exclusively to a specific natural person. The legal framework for data protection may be found in the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG). The provisions below serve to provide information as to the manner, extent and purpose for collecting, using and processing personal information by the provider Wine Staging. Please be aware that data transfer via the internet is subject to security risks and, therefore, complete protection against third-party access to transferred data cannot be ensured.</p>

	<h4>Cookies</h4>
	<p>Some of our websites make use of so-called cookies in order to recognize repeat use of our website by the same user/internet connection subscriber. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser downloads and stores on your computer. They are used to improve our website and services. In most cases these are so-called "session cookies" that are deleted once you leave our website. To an extent, however, these cookies also pass along information used to automatically recognize you. Recognition occurs through unique data saved to the cookies. The information thereby obtained is used to improve our services and to expedite your access to the website. You can prevent cookies from being installed by adjusting the settings on your browser software accordingly. You should be aware, however, that by doing so you may not be able to make full use of all the functions of our website.</p>

	<h4>Server Data</h4>
	<p>For technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files), is collected:</p>

	<ul>
	    <li>type and version of the browser you use</li>
	    <li>operating system</li>
	    <li>websites that linked you to our site (referrer URL)</li>
	    <li>websites that you visit</li>
	    <li>date and time of your visit</li>
	    <li>your Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>
	</ul>

	<p>This anonymous data is stored separately from any personal information you may have provided, thereby making it impossible to connect it to any particular person. The data is used for statistical purposes in order to improve our website and services. When we have clues which lead to the legitimate suspicion of unlawful use of our services, we also reserve the right to use server log files to investigate the incident.</p>

	<h4>Registration</h4>
	<p>We offer you the opportunity to sign up for our website. A registration is required in order to use the patch tracker or build server service. The information entered when signing up, as shown in the registration form (username, email address) is collected and stored solely for use by our website. You will also receive a confirmation email which is used to determine if you are actually the owner of the email address entered. None of this information is transferred to third parties. Nor is any of this information matched to any information that may be collected by other components of our website.</p>

	<h4>Social account login</h4>
	<p>We also offer you the opportunity to login with your GitHub account without prior registration on our website. In order to verify your identity, you will be redirected to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/" target="_blank">GitHub.com</a>, where you can enter your login credentials. During first login we will also synchronize your GitHub profile data (username, email address and real name) with our servers and send you a confirmation email to ensure the email address is valid. None of this information is transferred to third parties. Nor is any of this information matched to any information that may be collected by other components of our website.</p>

All profile settings are optional, and are not required in order to use our website. Please note that unless mentioned otherwise, all information entered on your profile page will be publicly available and can be seen by other visitors of our website.</p>

	<h4>Patch tracker / Build service</h4>
	<p>As a registered user, we offer you the opportunity to post patches, discuss with other developers, and to use the integrated build service on our website. Due to the nature of open source projects, all information entered by you will be publicly available and can be seen by other visitors of our website. To give you credit for your contributions, your submissions will also be linked to your profile.</p>

	<h4>Subscriptions</h4>
	<p>As a registered user, we offer you the opportunity to subscribe to patches, comments and status changes.
