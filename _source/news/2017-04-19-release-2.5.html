Title: Release 2.5
Date: Wed, 19 Apr 2017

<p>
The Wine Staging release 2.5 is now available.
</p>

<p>
What's new in this release:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Implementation of NtSuspendProcess and NtResumeProcess.</li>
    <li>Support for hash links in Ldr modules.</li>
    <li>Various smaller improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please note that starting with this version, Wine Staging uses the new server side message-mode named pipe implementation from the development branch. In contrast to our previous implementation using <code>SOCK_SEQPACKET</code> sockets, the new implementation allows to handle some corner cases more correctly and is cross-platform compatible. A small disadvantage is that the new implementation is less complete (for example no <code>PIPE_NOWAIT</code> handling), so there is a small risk of regressions.
</p>
