    <li>Various smaller bug fixes and improvements.</li>

<p>
Wine Staging 2.18 adds support for ECDSA certificate chain verification, which is required by various libcef based programs. This fixes the login issue in Origin, the connectivity problems in Uplay, the non-working browser in Battle.net and many more applications. So far the feature is only available when compiling Wine with the GnuTLS (>= 3.0) backend. This release also improves the swap interval handling of Direct3D10/11 games and makes it possible to disable vsync. There are also various smaller changes that fix bugs in games like Cuphead and Overwatch.
