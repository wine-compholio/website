<p>
Wine Staging 2.17 introduces the support for two commonly used Direct3D11 features: Interpolation modifiers for pixel shader inputs as well as the generation of mipmap levels of shader resource views. These two changes fix rendering glitches in Witcher 3, Overwatch, Prey (2017) and most probably affect more applications. Besides the graphic related changes, this release also extends the exception handling on 64 bit and improves the formatting of XML output in msxml.
