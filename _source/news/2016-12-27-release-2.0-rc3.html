Title: Release 2.0-rc3
Date: Tue, 27 Dec 2016

<p>
The Wine Staging release 2.0-rc3 is now available.
</p>

<p>
What's new in this release:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add basic AES-GCM support in bcrypt.</li>
    <li>Various improvements in gdiplus.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This release implements the Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for AES in <code>bcrypt.dll</code> which fixes the multiplayer mode of DOOM (2016). This features requires a Wine build linked against GnuTLS 3.0 or higher, which should be available on most modern distributions. To verify this, you can check the output of <code style="display: inline-block;">wine --check-libs</code> and search for the line referring to libgnutls. If the ABI version (the part behind <code>.so</code>) is 28 or higher, you are ready to play DOOM online.
