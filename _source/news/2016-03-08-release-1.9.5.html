Title: Release 1.9.5
Date: Tue, 8 Mar 2016

<p>
Time for another release - Wine Staging 1.9.5 is now available. This version improves the compatibility with MSYS and with various older games.
</p>

<p>
In continuation of our effort in the last version, this Wine Staging release adds a bunch of improvements mainly useful for older games and applications. Although probably not interesting for everyone, we improved the compatibility with Windows 95/98/ME in order to run software targeting these Windows versions. This includes miming the behavior of older Windows versions more correctly when selecting them in <code>winecfg</code>. So don't forget to alter the settings accordingly before trying out older games.
</p>

<p>
Besides some improvements for MSYS, this release also implements various additional functions in Wines <code>setupapi.dll</code>. Various fixes in preparation for loading multiple drivers into a single process, a <code>ntoskrnl.exe</code> bug which has been in Wine for a very long time, have already been accepted upstream and are not separately listed below. This is ongoing work though, so hopefully the next release will support loading multiple drivers into the same address space, making it possible to implement layered drivers as a next step.
