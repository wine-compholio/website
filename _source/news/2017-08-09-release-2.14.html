Title: Release 2.14
Date: Wed, 09 Aug 2017

<p>
The Wine Staging release 2.14 is now available.
</p>

<p>
What's new in this release:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Basic UAC implementation.</li>
    <li>Further heap manager performance improvements.</li>
    <li>Various smaller bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Wine Staging 2.14 adds a basic User Account Control (UAC) implementation, which allows to emulate an environment where processes have either limited user rights or admin rights. So far Wine always reported full admin rights to all applications, which is no longer the case on modern Windows versions. UAC was first available in Windows Vista, and is used to ensure only trusted processes can access system components. In our case the security aspect is mostly irrelevant and the main goal is to ensure compatibility with certain applications, which refuse to run when the privileges do not exactly match the Windows behavior. If an application asks you to restart without admin rights, this can now be done with <code>wine runas /trustlevel:0x20000 program.exe</code>. As a general reminder, please note that you should never run Wine as root user - emulation of admin rights for Windows applications is not related to any privileges on your host system, neither before nor after this change.
