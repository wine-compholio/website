Title: Release 1.9.11
Date: Tue, 31 May 2016

<p>
Wine Staging 1.9.11 has been released this weekend. This release is a small update containing only a few improvements targeting different applications.
</p>

<p>
Besides updating the existing patches (including CSMT) to be compatible with the current development release of Wine, this release contains only a few additions. The most noticeable one is a patch to fix a crash when launching DOOM. However, this doesn't mean that the whole DRM protection is working yet, but it is a first step. We also fixed a regression that caused problems when creating threads on FreeBSD and could also lead to issues on some Linux systems. A list containing all newly added patches is available below.
