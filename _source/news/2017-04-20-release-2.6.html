Title: Release 2.6
Date: Thu, 20 Apr 2017

<p>
The Wine Staging release 2.6 is now available.
</p>

<p>
What's new in this release:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Support for recent versions of OSMesa.</li>
    <li>Various smaller improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since a lot of users were confused after reading the development version release notes, we would like to clarify, that the command stream multithreading (CSMT) patchset <b>has not been fully merged yet</b>. There has been a lot of progress during the last weeks, but unfortunately the performance related optimizations are still missing in the development branch. We expect them to be merged in one of the following releases. In the meantime, Wine Staging users can continue to use the CSMT performance improvements as usual (i.e. by enabling the CSMT in the winecfg Staging tab).

<p>
In addition, Wine Staging users will also benefit from the following changes merged in the development branch:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>More Shader Model 5 instructions.</li>
	<li>More support for 3D textures.</li>
	<li>Better font transformations in DirectWrite.</li>
	<li>Various bug fixes.</li>
</ul>
