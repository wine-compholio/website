<p>
Wine Staging 2.12 contains various Direct3D 10/11 improvements and fixes rendering bugs in multiple applications, including Assassin's Creed III, Witcher 3, Trackmania Turbo or the Unigine Heaven benchmark. Besides these rendering fixes, users of the MESA driver no longer need to create the <code>MaxVersionGL</code> registry key when using Direct3D 10/11 applications. Starting with this release, Wine automatically detects when to use a core or compatibility context. This release also fixes a startup issue with the latest version of the Steam client (Thursday, 06 July 2017).
