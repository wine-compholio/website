Title: Release 2.16
Date: Thu, 07 Sep 2017

<p>
The Wine Staging release 2.16 is now available.
</p>

<p>
What's new in this release:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Extended deferred rendering context support in d3d11.</li>
    <li>Added 64 bit syscall thunks in fake ntdll.dll.</li>
    <li>Support for indexed vertex blending in d3d8/d3d9.</li>
    <li>Smaller bug fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Wine Staging 2.16 adds more deferred rendering context functions and fixes rendering bugs in games like Crysis 3, Witcher 3 or Prey (2017). The ntdll syscall thunk emulation was extended to 64 bit in this release, which is required by the 64 bit version of World of Warcraft. A newly added feature is the support for indexed vertex blending, which is especially used by older games to simulate bones. Wine Staging 2.16 also backports a patch to fix the font rendering in Steam, Uplay and other software using libcef in Windows 7 mode.
