	<h3 class="title">Source</h2>

	<p>Wine Staging is an open source project licensed under the LGPL2 license (with some exceptions, see <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/blob/master/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">here</a>). The source code is currently hosted on <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Please note that this repository only contains patches. In order to build Wine Staging, you'll also need the source of the corresponding Wine development release. The repository also contains a couple of helper scripts to simplify the steps of applying all or a subset of the patches. Detailed instructions how to build Wine Staging are available in our <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/wiki/Packaging" target="_blank">packaging instructions</a>.

	<h3 class="title">Contributing</h2>

	<p>Wine Staging mainly concentrates on experimental features and patches which are difficult to get into the development branch. If you have a very simple bug fix including tests, there is usually no need to send it to Wine Staging. You can directly contribute it to the <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/SubmittingPatches" target="_blank">development branch</a>. However, if you already tried that without success, or are working on such a complex area that you do not really think its ready for inclusion, you might want to submit it to our Staging tree. Please open a patch submission request on <a href="https://bugs.wine-staging.com/" target="_blank">bugs.wine-staging.com</a> including the patch. More information is also available in our <a href="https://github.com/wine-compholio/wine-staging/wiki/Contributing" target="_blank">Wiki</a>.</p>
